# MinecraftRoboticsCompetition
 Spigot plugin for running MRC minigames. Designed and developed by Nicholas Bottone.

 MRC is a simulated version of the [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) game [Infinite Recharge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmiYWTmFRVE) inside of Minecraft. This project is unofficial and not affiliated with FIRST.

 This project was designed for the [Bottone.io MC](https://mc.bottone.io) network, but it is now open source for anyone to use! You can connect to `mc.bottone.io` in Minecraft Java Edition or Bedrock Edition to play or test the MRC minigame online.
 
## Requirements
 * This plugin is designed to be run on a server by itself. Do not attempt to run MRC minigames alongside other worlds/gamemodes on the same server. If you intent to run more than one world/gamemode on your network, you should use Bungeecord or Waterfall.
 
 * This plugin is designed to be run on a specific pre-made world. It uses hardcoded location values, so it is important that you use the proper MRC arena world.
 
 * [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) (or any of its forks) 1.15.2+
   * [Paper](https://papermc.io/) (the high performance fork of Spigot) is recommended
 
 * [HolographicDisplays](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/holographic-displays) 2.4.3+
 
 * [Vault](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/vault) 1.7+
 
 * [WorldEdit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldedit) 7.1.0+
